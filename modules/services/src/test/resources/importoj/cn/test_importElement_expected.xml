                            appropriate, for each of the ESI Funds. That methodology shall consist of assigning a
                            specific weighting to the support provided under the ESI Funds at a level which reflects the
                            extent to which such support makes a contribution to climate change mitigation and
                            adaptation goals. The specific weighting assigned shall be differentiated on the basis of

                            contribution is insignificant, a weighting of zero shall be assigned. In the case of the

                            the case of the EMFF to measures set out in the EMFF Regulation.

                                replacement costs of short-life equipment incurred during the corresponding period.
