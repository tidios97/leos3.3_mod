                            Member States shall provide information on the support for climate change objectives using a

                            appropriate, for each of the ESI Funds. That methodology shall consist of assigning a
                            specific weighting to the support provided under the ESI Funds at a level which reflects the
                            extent to which such support makes a contribution to climate change mitigation and

                                operation, such as charges borne directly by users for the use of infrastructure, sale
                                or rent of land or buildings, or payments for services less any operating costs and
                                replacement costs of short-life equipment incurred during the corresponding period.
                                Operating cost-savings generated by the operation shall be treated as net revenue unless
                                they are offset by an equal reduction in operating subsidies.
