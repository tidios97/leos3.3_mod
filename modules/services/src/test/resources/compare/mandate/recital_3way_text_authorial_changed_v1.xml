                of the Council of 15 December 1997 on common rules for the development of the internal
                market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service (OJ L 15,

        . That Directive establishes common rules governing the provision of postal services and the
        universal postal service in the Union. This Regulation complements, insofar as cross-border
        parcel delivery services are concerned, the rules set out in Directive 97/67/EC.
