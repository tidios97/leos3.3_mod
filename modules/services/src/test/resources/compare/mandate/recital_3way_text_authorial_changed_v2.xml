    <p leos:origin="ec" xml:id="recs_YWSt5l">Currently, postal services are regulated by Directive
        97/67/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
        <authorialNote leos:origin="ec" xml:id="recs_w33BYF" marker="4">
            <p leos:origin="ec" xml:id="recs_Y1RGfM">Directive 97/67/EC of the European Parliament and
                of the Council of 15 December 1997 on common rules for the development of the internal
                market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service (OJ L 15,
                21.1.1998, p 14 - 25).

        . That Directive establishes common rules governing the provision of postal services and the
        universal postal service in the Union. It focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on national
        universal services and does not address regulatory oversight of parcel delivery service
        providers. Compliance with the minimum universal service requirements laid down in the directive
        is ensured by national regulatory authorities designated by the Member States. This Regulation,
        therefore, complements, insofar as cross-border parcel delivery services are concerned, the
        rules set out in Directive 97/67/EC. The provisions of this Regulation are without prejudice to
        the rights and guarantees set out in that Directive including in particular the continued
        provision of a universal postal service to users.
