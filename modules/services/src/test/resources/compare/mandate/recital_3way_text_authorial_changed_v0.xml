                of the Council of 15 December 1997 on common rules for the development of the internal
                market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service (OJ L 1,

        . This Directive establishes common rules governing the provision of postal services and the
        universal postal service in the Union. It focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on national
        universal services and does not address regulatory oversight of parcel delivery service
        providers, transparency of tariffs and terminal rates for certain cross-border parcel delivery
        services, the assessment of the affordability of tariffs for certain cross-border parcel
        delivery services and transparent and non-discriminatory access to certain cross-border parcel
        delivery services and/or infrastructure. This Regulation therefore complements, insofar as
        cross-border parcel delivery services are concerned, the rules set out in Directive 97/67/EC.
