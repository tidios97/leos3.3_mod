    <p class="leos-double-compare-removed" xml:id="deleted_recs_iqjGkS">The Union's international trade is subject to both customs
        legislation and Union non-customs legislation. The latter is applicable to specific goods in
        policy areas such as health and safety, the environment, agriculture, fisheries, cultural
        heritage and market surveillance. One of the main tasks assigned to customs authorities in line
        with Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the <span class="leos-double-compare-removed">
            European</span>Parliament and of the Council

            <p xml:id="recs_qfdztM">Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European
                Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L

        is to ensure the security and safety of the Union and its residents, and the protection of the
        environment, where appropriate, in close cooperation with other authorities. The authorities
        responsible for Union non-customs regulatory formalities (‘partner competent authorities’) and
        customs authorities often work in silos, creating complex and burdensome reporting obligations
        for traders and inefficient goods clearance processes conducive to
        <span class="leos-double-compare-removed">error and fraud</span>
        <span class="leos-double-compare-added">fraud and error</span>. To address the fragmented
        interoperability between customs and partner competent authorities in the management of goods
        clearance processes and to coordinate action in this area, the Commission and the Member States
        have taken a number of commitments over the years to develop single window initiatives for the
        clearance of goods.
