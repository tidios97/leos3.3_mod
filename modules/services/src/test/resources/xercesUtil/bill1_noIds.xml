                    <p>The G-20 Declaration of 2 April 2009 on Strengthening of the Financial
                        System called for internationally consistent efforts that are aimed at strengthening
                        transparency, accountability and regulation by improving the quantity and quality of capital in
                        the banking system once the economic recovery is assured. That declaration also called for
                        introduction of a supplementary non-risk based measure to contain the build-up of leverage in
                        the banking system, and the development of a framework for stronger liquidity buffers. In
                        response to the mandate given by the G-20, in September 2009 the Group of Central Bank Governors
                        and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), agreed on a number of measures to strengthen the regulation of
                        the banking sector. Those measures were endorsed by the G-20 leaders at their Pittsburgh Summit
                        of 24-25 September 2009 and were set out in detail in December 2009. In July and September 2010,
                        GHOS issued two further announcements on design and calibration of those new measures, and in
                        December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published the final measures,
                        that are referred to as the Basel III framework.

                        de Larosière (the "de Larosière group") invited the Union to develop a more harmonised
                        set of financial regulations. In the context of the future European supervisory architecture,
                        the European Council of 18 and 19 June 2009 also stressed the need to establish a 'European
                        Single Rule Book' applicable to all credit institutions and investment firms in the
                        internal market.
