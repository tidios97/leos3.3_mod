                residential or commercial immovable property or a mortgage on such property, it shall include shares
                in Finnish residential housing companies operating in accordance with the Finnish Housing Company
                Act of 1991 or subsequent equivalent legislation. Member States or their competent authorities may
                allow shares constituting an equivalent indirect holding of real estate to be treated as a direct
                holding of real estate provided that such an indirect holding is specifically regulated in the
                national law of the Member State concerned and that, when pledged as collateral, it provides
                equivalent protection to creditors.
