ABOUT LEOS
================================================================================

    LEOS is a software that was created under ISA2 Action 2016.38 Legislation 
Interoperability Tools - LegIT to address the need of the public administration 
and European Institutions to generate draft legislation in a legal XML format. 
    
    It is a legislation editor and this current prototype supports the drafting 
of the 'secondary' legislation of the EU law which has to be adopted under the 
Ordinary Legislative Procedure. 

    Therefore, it covers the writing of Proposals for Directive, Decision and 
Regulation submitted by the Commission to the Council and the Parliament.

    If you want to find out more about this procedure, please read the European 
Parliament's article.
europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers

    Given the high diversity of legislative traditions encountered across the 
Union and the different levels of modernisation, it was extremely difficult to 
provide a universal single turnkey ICT solution that adapts to each specific 
context.

    Even if a significant part of the business logic can be found embedded in 
the code, we design with the goal of delivering re-usable building blocks so 
LEOS is released Open Source as we believe that some parts of it could be reused
and adapted by some other Public Administration having similar needs.

    For more information on the features please follow us on Joinup:
joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/leos-open-source-software-editing-legislation

    The code is available for free under EUPL licence (version 1.2 or – as soon they 
 will be approved by the European Commission - subsequent 
 versions of the EUPL (the "Licence")), and the development team 
paid attention to organise the code in a structured way to ease its reusability 
(modules, plugins…).
    For more information on the EUPL licence:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl

    The LEOS demo provided in our release comes with an example user interface 
that includes the logo of the European Commission. 
This is just for demonstration purpose and please note that the logo of the 
European Commission may be used by third parties only if:
-  Permission is requested and granted before the logo is used
-  There is no likelihood of the user of the logo being confused with the 
European Commission
-  It is not used in connection with objectives or activities which are 
incompatible with the aims and principles of the European Commission
-  It is not used to imply or suggest unintended endorsement or promotion of the
objectives and activities of the user of the logo by the European Commission

WHAT'S NEW?
================================================================================
The main differences compared to the previous version are:

-	Improved Annotations with new bulk actions and revisited logic for orphan handling as well as enhanced UI for better user experience;
-	New Search&Replace functionality with fine grained occurrences detection option, improved navigation over results and enhanced replace functionality;
-	Core XML handling library migrated to Xerces, resulting in revised Architecture, better code testing coverage and performance enhancements;
-	Enhanced collaborators management feature;
-	First iteration of new standalone export module that enables the extraction of HTML renditions given a .leg package;
-	Several bug fixes and enhanced editing experience;

WHAT'S GONE?
