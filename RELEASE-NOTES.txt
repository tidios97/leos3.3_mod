ABOUT LEOS
================================================================================

LEOS (Legislation Editing Open Software) is a software designed to address the need of the public administrations and European Institutions to generate draft legislation in a legal XML format. It was created under ISA Programme - ISA Action 1.13. LEOS - Legislation Editing Open Software and it continued to evolved under ISA2 Action 2016.38 Legislation Interoperability Tools - LegIT.  The LEOS journey continues under Digital Europe Programme (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme).

LEOS has been created to addresses the modernisation and digital transformation of the drafting and revising of legislation in EU Institutions, EU agencies and bodies and Member States. The aim is to:

-  Improve the quality of legislation.
-  Increase the efficiency of the legislative process across the Union.
-  Facilitate interoperability and seamless cooperation between the different actors in the legislative process in and between EU Institutions and Member States.
-  Improve transparency and accessibility and thus effectiveness of law.
-  Explore and pilot the use of innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.

It is based on the Akoma Ntoso XML format an OASIS LegalDocML standard (in particular, it supports the AKN4EU interinstitutional instantiation subschema of Akoma Ntoso) that facilitates interoperability between EU institutions and Member States

The code is available for free under EUPL licence (version 1.2 or – as soon they will be approved by the European Commission - subsequent versions of the EUPL (the "Licence")), and the development team paid attention to organise the code in a structured way to ease its reusability (modules, plugins…).  

For more information on the EUPL licence, please visit this https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl. 

WHAT'S NEW?
================================================================================
What’s new?
This Beta version is currently used for a pilot across the Commission services. 
The main differences compared to the previous prototype version are:
-  Acts are managed as a set of elements (explanatory memorandum, legal text, 
annexes…) and global metadata are propagated across sub-elements
-  Improved version management, with major versions and possibility to see 
differences between versions
-  Import feature, enabling to import some content already published in the 
Official Journal of the EU
-  New security layer
-  Support of images
-  Improved table of content edition
-  Possible to add comments & highligts using annotations
-  Possible to add suggestions on a part of text with the feature to accept and 
reject a suggestion


WHAT'S GONE?
================================================================================
What’s gone?
Note that some features of the prototype were removed :
- The locking of the edited area and the notifications mechanism have not been 
retained because judged too cumbersome; it might come back under another form
- The pdf rendering is now delegated to a service external to the project 
- Feedback view is removed as workflows are not part of system


GET IN TOUCH
================================================================================

    We are envisaging to create an open source community on software for 
legislation drafting, in order to share best practices, experiences, expertise, 
and why not code!!
Should you be interested or would you just like to share with us some 
observations on our work, you can join the conversation one legislative drafting
